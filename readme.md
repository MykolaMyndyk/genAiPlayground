# Running the Spring Application

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to run the Spring Boot application.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you'll need:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
2. Maven 3.x
3. MySQL server (If the application uses a MySQL database)

## Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to a directory of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd repository
```

3. If the application uses a database, ensure your MySQL server is running and you have created a database for the application.

4. Update the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory with your database information.

```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

5. Use Maven to clean and build the project.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

6. After the build process is complete, you can run the application using one of the following methods:

    - Run the `main` method from your IDE.

    - If you use the Spring Boot Maven plugin, run the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Conclusion

You should now be able to run the application and access it on `http://localhost:8080`. If you encounter any issues, please review the steps and ensure you followed them correctly.
